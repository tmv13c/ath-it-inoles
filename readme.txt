This project was an attempt to pull the recruting video from the IT server rather than have it embedded in the code.
We wanted to make it easier to change the video and avoid directly changing the source code.

After trial and error the video loads and replays, but there is about a minute delay between each replay. Due to lack of swift knowledge and time
I was unable to figure out why.

We also decided to avoid this method of pulling the video because with over 100 iPads pulling the video, there was a possibility of overloading the server with requests.
